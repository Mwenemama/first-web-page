		<p>Web pages are like regular pages, but online. Thanks, Captain Obvious! This is a useful comparison to explore, though. Consider a newspaper page. On it, you have headings, sections, articles, images, and layouts which organize content that's styled to look a certain way </p>
		<p class="secondparagraph">Back in the old days, it was someone's responsibility to physically arrange elements on a newspaper printing press in order to tell a story. They would set attention-grabbing headlines, for example, that were complemented by content in paragraphs. They would lay out the different sections and articles on a page according to the hierarchy of the content and the story they wanted to tell via these elements</p>
		<p>Then, depending on the newspaper, the exact type-setting would have a certain font and characteristic style. The aesthetic appearance of the page is different from the content itself.</p>
